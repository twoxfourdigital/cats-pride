# Front End Best Practices

- Install node_modules using command: npm install

- Add fonts
    1. download font families you need
    2. go to website https://transfonter.org/, upload your font and select WOOF, WOOF2, TTF and EOT, also check "Fix vertical metrics"), after that convert fonts and download it
    3. copy all downloaded font files to folder /assets/fonts
    4. copy styles to file /assets/scss/global/_fonts.scss and make sure you hit relative path to font files within folder /assets/fonts

- Define all variables that meet the needs of the project (file: /assets/scss/global/_variables.scss)
    1. $container-width variable (this is your .container width based on provided design)
    2. colors
    3. $primary-font and $secondary-font
    4. font sizes

- Define typography (file: /assets/scss/global/_typography.scss)
    1. font sizes for p tag, headings (h1, h2, h3...)
    2. if every section have the same heading font size and line heaight, good practice is to define class, for exapmle .section-title within _typography.scss
